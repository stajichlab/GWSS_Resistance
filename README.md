### Abstract

<b>Background: </b> <i> Homalodisca vitripennis</i> Germar, the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is an invasive insect in California and a critical threat to agriculture through its transmission of the plant pathogen, <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>. Quarantine and broad-spectrum insecticides have been used for population management of <i>H. vitripennis </i>since its invasion and subsequent proliferation throughout California. However, recently wide-spread neonicotinoid resistance has been found in populations of <i>H. vitripennis</i> in the southern portions of Californiaâ€™s Central Valley. In order to better understand potential mechanisms of <i>H. vitripennis</i> neonicotinoid resistance, we performed RNA sequencing on wild-caught insecticide resistant and relatively susceptible sharpshooters to profile their transcriptome and population structure. 

<b>Results:</b> We identified 81 differentially expressed genes with higher expression in resistant individuals. The significant largest differentially expressed candidate gene linked to resistance status was a cytochrome P450 gene with similarity to CYP6A9. Further, we observed an over-enrichment of GO terms representing functions supportive of roles in resistance mechanisms (cytochrome P450s, M13 peptidases, and cuticle structural proteins). Finally, we saw no evidence of broad-scale population structure, perhaps due to  <i>H. vitripennis'</i> relatively recent introduction to California or due to the relatively small geographic scale investigated here. 

<b>Conclusions:</b> In this work, we characterized the transcriptome of insecticide resistant and susceptible <i>H. vitripennis</i> and identified candidate genes that may be involved in resistance mechanisms for this species. Future work should seek to build on the transcriptome profiling performed here to confirm the role of the identified genes, particularly the cytochrome P450, in resistance in  <i>H. vitripennis</i>. We hope this work helps aid future population management strategies for this and other species with growing insecticide resistance.
